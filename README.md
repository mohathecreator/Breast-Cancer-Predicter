# Breast-Cancer-Predicter

## Description 
This is my first Machine Learning project. I trained a model based on the
Breast Cancer Dataset provided by the SciKit library.
I will update this project as time goes on

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
This program runs in Python.
You will need the following libraries:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
  
Make sure to have those libraries installed before running the programm

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mohathecreator/Breast-Cancer-Predicter
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Breast-Cancer-Predicter
    ```
3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```


## Usage
Run the program. The results should be displayed in your console alongside a plot showing all features sorted by importance for the model, from worst to best. 

## Future plans
I plan on making this project accessible to other users.
One way I plan to do this is by creating some kind of web-application, where users can provide their own breast cancer data and get an output if the tumor is good or bad.
As stated earlier, this project will receive more updates as time goes on.
